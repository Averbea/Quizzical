# Quizzical
This project is my take on a Quiz Application.
Feel free to try out the latest version [here](https://averbea.github.io/Quizzical)

It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The app is heavily inspired by the solo project at the end of the course **Learn React for free** on <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact"><img src=https://scrimba.com/static/art/dark-logo.svg height=14></a>

Data is gathered from the [open trivia database ](https://opentdb.com)

## Scrimba template
The idea of the so called "solo projects" on scrimba is that the user conceptualizes and creates a project based on a given idea and a given design template while using the things learned previously in the course.

You can find the said design template on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/E9S5iPcm10f0RIHK8mCqKL/Quizzical-App?node-id=0%3A1).
